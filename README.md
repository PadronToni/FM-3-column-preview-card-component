## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- BEM methodology
- ITCSS architecture


### What I learned

Basically nothing, but I had a chance to test my speed!
In fact to make all the implementation it took me only 2 hours, starting from scratch to the (probably) over engineered solution.
It was very funny!
